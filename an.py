# note: The average human brain has about 86 billion neurons(or nerve cells) and many more neuroglia (or glial cells) which serve to 
# support and protect the neurons (although see the end of this page for more information on glial cells). Each neuron may be connected 
# to up to 10,000 other neurons, passing signals to each other via as many as 1,000 trillion synaptic connections, equivalent by some
#  estimates to a computer with a 1 trillion bit per second processor. Estimates of the human brainâ€™s memory capacity vary wildly from 
# 1 to 1,000 terabytes
